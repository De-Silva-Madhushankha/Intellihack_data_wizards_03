Because the load of different experts may vary depending on the current workload, it is important to keep the load of different GPUs balanced. As described in the DeepSeek-V3 paper, we adopt a redundant experts strategy that duplicates heavy-loaded experts. Then, we heuristically pack the duplicated experts to GPUs to ensure load balancing across different GPUs. Moreover, thanks to the group-limited expert routing used in DeepSeek-V3, we also attempt to place the experts of the same group to the same node to reduce inter-node data traffic, whenever possible.\\n\\nTo facilitate reproduction and deployment, we open-source our deployed EP load balancing algorithm in eplb.py. The algorithm computes a balanced expert replication and placement plan based on the estimated expert loads. Note that the exact method to predict the loads of experts is out of this repo's scope. A common method is to use moving average of historical statistics.\\n\\n## The Algorithm\\n\\nThe load balancing algorithm comes with two policies used for different cases.\\n\\n## Hierarchical Load Balancing\\n\\nWhen the number of server nodes divides the number of expert groups, we use the hierarchical load balancing policy to harness the group-limited expert routing. We first pack the expert groups to nodes evenly, ensuring the loads of different nodes are balanced. Then, we replicate the experts within each node. Finally, we pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs to ensure different GPUs are load-balanced. The hierarchical load balancing policy can be used in prefilling stage with a smaller expert-parallel size.\\n\\n### Global Load Balancing\",\n          \"> of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage\\n> to the broader research community.\\n>\\n> **3.** **Experiment**\\n>\\n> **Benchmarks** We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020),\\n> MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval\\n> (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et\\n> al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al.,\\n> 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024),\\n> SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI,\\n>\\n> 11\\n>\\n> 2024d), Aider 1, LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024) (2024-08 \\u2013\\n> 2025-01), Codeforces 2, Chinese National High School Mathematics\\n> Olympiad (CNMO 2024)3, and American Invitational Math-ematics\\n> Examination 2024 (AIME 2024) (MAA, 2024).

They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let\\u2019s see the math behind it.\\ne\\u1d62 is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert\\u2019s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in.\\nu\\u209c is input vector to FFN. The dot product u\\u209c\\u1d40 e\\u1d62 quantifies the similarity between the input vector u\\u209c\\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert e\\u1d62, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert\\u2019s specialized domain. So, the s\\u1d62 = Sigmoid(u\\u209c\\u1d40 e\\u1d62) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value g\\u1d62, which select K\\u1d63 experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output.\\n2.3 Multi-Token Prediction\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This could lead to a situation where a write has been committed locally, but the remote site is still processing a previous or subsequent write request (hence the \\\"pending\\\" version being different).\\n\\n2.  **Partial Write Completion:** A write operation might have partially completed on the local replica but failed to propagate to the remote replica before a metadata synchronization check occurred.\\n\\n3.  **Node Failure and Recovery:** A write request could have been in-flight to the remote replica when it failed. The local node successfully committed the write, but the remote node didn't receive it. After the remote node recovers, the pending write information might be out of sync.\\n\\n4.  **Concurrency Issues:** While chain versioning is meant to address concurrency, bugs or suboptimal implementation of the write protocol could still lead to race conditions where version numbers are inconsistent.\\n\\n5.  **Metadata Inconsistency:** An error in the metadata management system itself might cause incorrect committed or pending version numbers to be reported.\",\n          \"The effect of node `A` continuing to forward the request is that it allows the request to eventually reach a node (`C`) that *does* have the latest chain table and can therefore process the request successfully. This ensures that requests are not simply dropped if they encounter an outdated node, but instead have a chance to be fulfilled once the necessary information becomes available within the system. Without the forwarding mechanism, the request would be unsuccessful.\\n\\n**Question 5: Critical Thinking Question**\",\n          \"The meta service uses the rendezvous hash algorithm to distribute file length update tasks across multiple meta services.\\n\\n**Question 2: (Comparative Question)**\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Network DelaysOut of Order Delivery: Write requests and their corresponding acknowledgments might experience network delays or be delivered out of order. This could lead to a situation where a write has been committed locally, but the remote site is still processing a previous or subsequent write request hence the \\\"pending\\\" version being different.\\n\\n2.  Partial Write Completion: A write operation might have partially completed on the local replica but failed to propagate to the remote replica before a metadata synchronization check occurred.\\n\\n3.  Node Failure and Recovery: A write request could have been inflight to the remote replica when it failed. The local node successfully committed the write, but the remote node didn't receive it. After the remote node recovers, the pending write information might be out of sync.\\n\\n4.  Concurrency Issues: While chain versioning is meant to address concurrency, bugs or suboptimal implementation of the write protocol could still lead to race conditions where version numbers are inconsistent.\\n\\n5.  Metadata Inconsistency: An error in the metadata management system itself might cause incorrect committed or pending version numbers to be reported.\",\n          \"The effect of node A continuing to forward the request is that it allows the request to eventually reach a node C that does have the latest chain table and can therefore process the request successfully. This ensures that requests are not simply dropped if they encounter an outdated node, but instead have a chance to be fulfilled once the necessary information becomes available within the system. Without the forwarding mechanism, the request would be unsuccessful.\\n\\nQuestion 5: Critical Thinking Question\",\n          \"The meta service uses the rendezvous hash algorithm to distribute file length update tasks across multiple meta services.\\n\\nQuestion 2: Comparative Question\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
